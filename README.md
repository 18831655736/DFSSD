# DFSSD: Deep Feature-aware Semi-Supervised Distillation

**DFSSD** is a deep learning-based framework for **industrial defect detection** under **semi-supervised learning** conditions. It leverages the concept of **teacher-student distillation** to train lightweight student models from large teacher models, achieving both high detection accuracy and low-latency inference.

## Introduction

**DFSSD** (Deep Feature-aware Semi-Supervised Distillation) is designed for industrial defect detection, where annotated data is limited. By employing **distillation-based training**, it trains a compact student model from a teacher model with significantly fewer parameters while maintaining robust detection accuracy.

Key features:
- **Teacher-student distillation**: Compresses a large teacher model (YOLOv8s) to a smaller student model (YOLOv8n) while preserving high performance.
- **Semi-supervised learning**: Uses a minimal amount of labeled data and pseudo-labeled data generated by the teacher model.
- **High efficiency**: Focuses on low-latency inference, making it suitable for real-time applications.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.6
- PyTorch >= 1.7
- CUDA (optional for GPU acceleration)

### Installing Dependencies 

   pip install -r requirements.txt

#### Data Preparation

1. **Dataset**: This repository uses the **CR7-DET** dataset for training and testing. The dataset can be downloaded from the following link:

   - [CR7-DET Dataset](<INSERT_YOUR_DATASET_LINK_HERE>)

2. **Data Splitting**: 
   - The **CR7-DET** dataset is split into **three subsets**: **training**, **validation**, and **testing**.
   - The data split is **80% for training**, **10% for validation**, and **10% for testing**. This ensures a balanced distribution for training the model, validating during training, and evaluating the final model's performance.
   - We use the **validation** set during training for hyperparameter tuning and model performance evaluation. The **test** set is used only for final evaluation after training is complete.

3. **Preprocessing**: 
   - The dataset undergoes several preprocessing steps, including resizing the images to a fixed size, normalization, and augmentation. The preprocessing steps are implemented in `data/preprocessing.py`.
   - You can adjust the preprocessing settings by modifying the configuration in the script.

### Training

To train the model, use the following command:

python train.py --teacher_model <path_to_teacher_model> --student_model <path_to_student_model> --dataset <path_to_dataset>
