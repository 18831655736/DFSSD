# DFSSD: Deep Feature-aware Semi-Supervised Distillation

**DFSSD** is a deep learning-based framework for **industrial defect detection** under **semi-supervised learning** conditions. It leverages the concept of **teacher-student distillation** to train lightweight student models from large teacher models, achieving both high detection accuracy and low-latency inference.

## Introduction

**DFSSD** (Deep Feature-aware Semi-Supervised Distillation) is designed for industrial defect detection, where annotated data is limited. By employing **distillation-based training**, it trains a compact student model from a teacher model with significantly fewer parameters while maintaining robust detection accuracy.

Key features:
- **Teacher-student distillation**: Compresses a large teacher model (YOLOv8s) to a smaller student model (YOLOv8n) while preserving high performance.
- **Semi-supervised learning**: Uses a minimal amount of labeled data and pseudo-labeled data generated by the teacher model.
- **High efficiency**: Focuses on low-latency inference, making it suitable for real-time applications.
